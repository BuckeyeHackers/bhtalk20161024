					<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>A hackathon is...</h2>
						<p>
							an event where people get together for an extended period of time and create awesome things, particularly with software or hardware.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>A hackathon isn't...</h2>
						<p>
							an event for evil programmers to get together and break into systems and steal information.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
						

				<section>
					<h1>Things to Know</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
					<p>
						The projects that win often aren't the most technically complex, but they're pretty, practical, and have a great UI/UX.
					</p>
					</section>
					<section>
					<p>
						There will be recruiters checking out the awesome stuff you do and looking to hire students for internships or full-time positions.
					</p>
					</section>
					<section>
					<p>
						You can put your experience and project from the hackathon on your resume to show employers that you love what you do and can accomplish great things!
					</p>
					</section>
				</section>
			
				<section>
					<h1>Before the Hackathon</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>SLEEP!</h2>
						<p>
							Aim to get 8-10 hours of sleep each night two nights before the hackathon.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Have an idea!</h2>
						<p>
							Know what you want to build before going in.
						</p>
						<p>
							Your idea may or may not change, but it helps a ton to have some sort of a direction, especially if you brainstorm how you could start making it before you begin.
						</p>
						<p>
							DON'T start coding your idea until the hackathon formally begins!
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Have a team!</h2>
						<p>
							A solid team either has members who can each do different parts of the project that require different skills, or who all have the same skillset if the idea only requires a few specific skills.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you don't have a team, the hackathon coordinators will have some sort of matchmaker service for teamless participants to form teams.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h1>Ready, Set, Hack!</h1>
				</section>

						<h2>Plan</h2>
						<p>
							Don't get into writing code until you know exactly what you want to do!
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>MVP</h2>
						<p>
							Think about the absolute minimal functionality of your idea and try to build that first.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Tools</h2>
						<p>
							High level languages and frameworks are your best friends.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
